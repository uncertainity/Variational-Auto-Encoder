# Variational-Auto-Encoder
We will implement the variational autoencoder algorithm for an image dataset of celebrity faces. We will use the trained encoder and decoder networks to reconstruct and generate images. We will also see how the latent space encodes high-level information about the images.

This is part of the coursework for "Probabilistic Deep Learning with Tensorflow 2"
